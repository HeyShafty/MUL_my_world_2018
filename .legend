Every map ending with a .world can be loaded.

The pattern in the files should be looking like this :
(x is the number of rows)
(y is the number of colums per rows)
(n is the altitude of a map point)

x y
n n n n ... n   (y times)
n n n n ... n   (y times)
n n n n ... n   (y times)
n n n n ... n   (y times)
.

n n n n ... n   (y times)
(x times)




Or you could just be launching the world editor and look for yourself !
